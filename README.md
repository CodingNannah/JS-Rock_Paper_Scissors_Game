This is a Computer vs. Computer "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, which I created after practicing Dave Gray's JS Tutorial for Beginners #1 through #7.

Game Creation Notes:
I changed the computer to playerTwo.

At first, I had a challenge with the players always coming out as a tie. Duh, they were both set equal to option. Then, I changed them to optionA and optionB.

I decided I wanted the options for playerOne and playerTwo to show with the win message, so I added that.
